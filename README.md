# Akeneo Automatic classification bundle

A bundle that extend the Pim Enterprise CatalogRuleBundle, adding the possibility to classify products.

## Requirements

 - Akeneo PIM EE 1.3.x stable

## Installation

As the Git repository is private, you need to add it to the composer.json of your project:

    "repositories": [
            {
                "type": "vcs",
                "url": "https://github.com/akeneo/AutomaticClassificationBundle.git",
                "branch": "master"
            }
        ]

Then install the bundle with composer:

    $ php composer.phar require akeneo/automatic-classification-bundle:1.0.*

If you want to use the development version (only for test purpose, do not use it in production), replace `1.0.*` by `dev-master` in the previous command.

Enable the bundle in the `app/AppKernel.php` file, in the `getPimEnterpriseBundles` function:

    return[
        â€¦
        new PimEnterprise\Bundle\AutomaticClassificationBundle\PimEnterpriseAutomaticClassificationBundle(),
    ];

Then clean the cache:

    php app/console cache:clear --env=prod

## Rule definition

This bundle is an extension of the CatalogRuleBundle, so it uses the same conditions, and add a new set of actions:

* `add_category`: add a product to a category,
* (more to come soon).

The category must exists, or the rule will not apply.

### Example

    rules:
        camera_add_canon_brand_category:
            conditions:
                - field:    family.code
                  operator: IN
                  value:
                    - camcorders
                - field:    name
                  operator: CONTAINS
                  value:    Canon
            actions:
                - type:         add_category
                  categoryCode: canon_category
